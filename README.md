# Investigating a Drop in User Engagement - Yammer Engagement Analysis

## Introduction

This project analyzes data from Mode Analytics about a company called Yammer. Below is some information about Yammer, sourced from the Mode website:

> **Yammer** is a social network for communicating with coworkers. Individuals share documents, updates, and ideas by posting them in groups. Yammer is free to use indefinitely, but companies must pay license fees if they want access to administrative controls, including integration with user management systems like ActiveDirectory.

The focus of this analysis is a noticeable drop in engagement on Yammer, starting around the end of July and continuing through the beginning of August.
